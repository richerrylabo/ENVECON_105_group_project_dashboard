        COâ‚‚ is the most abundant greenhouse gas emitted by human activities in the U.S. 
        By analyzing emissions data alongside long-term records of global temperature changes and U.S. natural disaster events, this study provides insight into how emissions trends have evolved and how they may connect to climate-related risks.
        Using data wrangling, visualization, and basic statistical analysis, this case study highlights patterns that can inform how we understand the climate consequences of greenhouse gas emissions.  \n\n"""
